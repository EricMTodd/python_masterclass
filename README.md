Python variables names must begin witha letter (either upper or lower case) or an underscore \_ character

They can contain letters, numbers or underscore characters (but cannot begin with a number).

Python variables are case sensitive, so greeting and Greeting would refer to 2 different variables.

Variables are created when they are first attached to a value, using =.

When comparing conditions using AND, python stops checking once it finds a condition that's False.

When comparing conditions using OR, python stops checking once it findns a condition that's True.
